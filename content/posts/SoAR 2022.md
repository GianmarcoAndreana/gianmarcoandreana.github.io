I will present the work I'm developing with my advisor, Professor [Nicole Adler](https://nicoleadler.huji.ac.il/), from the title "Aiding airlines for the benefit of whom? An applied game-theoretic model" at the [SoAR](https://sites.google.com/unibg.it/soar-bergamo/) in Bergamo.

Hope to see you there!
