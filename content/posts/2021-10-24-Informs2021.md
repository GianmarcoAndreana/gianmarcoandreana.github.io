I'm going to present the work I'm developing with my advisor, Professor [Nicole Adler](https://nicoleadler.huji.ac.il/), from the title "Aiding airlines for the benefit of whom? An applied game-theoretic model" at the [INFORMS Annual Meeting 2021](https://meetings.informs.org/wordpress/anaheim2021/).

See you there!
